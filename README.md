# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 using publicly available data. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling to understand trends and forecast future cases.

# Objectives
To preprocess and clean COVID-19 data from various sources.
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns.
To develop predictive models for forecasting COVID-19 cases.
To visualize the findings for better understanding and communication.

# Data Sources
The data used in this project is sourced from the following:

Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID-19 Data
World Health Organization (WHO)
COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University

# Methodology
Data Collection: Data was collected from the aforementioned sources.
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, standardized date formats, and merged datasets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted to uncover trends, peaks, and key statistics.
Modeling: Applied time-series models like ARIMA and machine learning models for prediction.
Visualization: Created visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to represent the data and results clearly.
